### 0.3.0 (2022-04-18)

**TL;DR** Many thanks to all for the great support and feedback. This release
marks a huge milestone for me especially with regards to VT backend performance(!),
improved rendering architecture, and a more complete list of pixel perfect box drawings.

- Fixes installation from `.deb` (missing terminfo dependency)
- Fixes PTY write race condition.
- Fixes VT sequence `DECFI`.
- Fixes VT sequence `ICH` (#559).
- Fixes VT sequence `OSC 4`'s response.
- Fixes VT sequence `OESC 4` to also support setting color via `#RRGGBB`.
- Fixes VT sequence extension: capture buffer (#493).
- Fixes `DECRC` with respect to `DECSTBM` enabled and `DECOM` being inverted interpreted.
- Fixes `XTGETTCAP` (#582).
- Fixes `SU` in combination with `DECLRM` (#593).
- Fixes an assertion in text renderer.
- Fixes wrongly advertising DEC locator mode (it is not supported).
- Improved VT backend performance (#342).
- Improved text selection behaviour.
- Improved detection of runtime DPI changes for KDE (Plasma) desktop environment.
- Improves Window manipulation VT sequence for saving/restoring window title (`CSI 22 ; Ps t`, `CSI 23 ; Ps t`)
- Adds pixel-perfect box-drawing for U+EE00 .. U+EE05 for progress bar glyphs as first introduced by Fira Code (#521).

- Adds preliminary implementation of `DA3` VT sequence.
- Adds new configuration option `mouse_block_selection_modifier`.
- Adds new configuration option `profiles.*.copy_last_mark_range_offset` (default `0`) to adjust where to start looking upwards for the `CopyPreviousMarkRange` action. This is useful for multi-line prompts.
- Adds new configuration option `platform_plugin`.
- Adds new configuration option `renderer.backend` for explicitly setting renderer to one of: `OpenGL`, `software`, `default`.
